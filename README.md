# Bibliopath

It all started from this badly written note: https://primal.net/e/nevent1qqs2q6urpp9df4qt0xt85nd7ewqxw9u42duqmyqdrlgc04g5fny6m0s6wdrdm

Gutemberg books: https://www.gutenberg.org/

üö® We do plan to self-host the index and books at the [Futurewise](https://www.futurewise.lat/) platform.

‚ö°Ô∏è Consider zapping a coffee ‚Äî [Here](https://njump.me/nprofile1qqs8wftkcz9achdy8ascqtnk0v3rrcevda2klm8wqyd6xrlk8skc22gekra89)

Have fun!

## To Do

- Ability to add your own books (from a raw github url or local epub upload)
- Create a http proxy on our Futurewise API to handle the fetch, rate limiting, etc.
- Create a store for theme state, use it in all routes.
- Once a book is downloaded offer to save it in indexDB and bookmark it.
- Search should change the query parameter.
- Nostr login
- Allow for github/nostrgit books written in markdown
  - Create a selection of curated books, with audio books.
- Allow users to store their own books in the reader (indexDB?)
- Disclaimer (only Creative Commons work)
- Info button to get book and author data.
- Centralize types at src/lib & componentize the thing.
- Multi-lingual support via paraglidejs.
- Shortcuts: CMD + K, etc.
- Better homepage hero and menus, with config switcher.
- Footer: Add version & better github link.
- Add favicons (considering the PWA future).
- Book downloading progress bar.
- Make Bibliopath an open-repository hosted at the Futurewise org.
- Create e-pub support (and consider moving from txt Gutemberg format to this, for better indexes and metadata).
- Pre-render authors at the hompage.
- Add more Nostr capabilities.
- Add changelog from git commits.
- AI
  - Enable read a chapter using something like ElevenLabs (paid).

- Bug: Fix the changeTheme function mess.
- Bug: On mobile pagination should be "Prev - Next" with the input switcher also.
- Bug: Font-size not working on mobile.
- Bug: No error message when downloading fails... no retry button.
- Progress bar:

```
<progress id="progress" value="0" max="100"></progress>
<pre id="output"></pre>

<script>
async function downloadWithProgress(url) {
	const response = await fetch(url);
	const contentLength = response.headers.get('Content-Length');

	if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network error');
	if (!contentLength) console.warn('No content length ‚Äî progress may be inaccurate');

	const total = parseInt(contentLength, 10) || 0;
	const reader = response.body.getReader();
	const decoder = new TextDecoder();
	let received = 0;
	let result = '';

	while (true) {
		const { done, value } = await reader.read();
		if (done) break;

		received += value.length;
		result += decoder.decode(value, { stream: true });

		// Update progress bar
		if (total) {
			document.getElementById('progress').value = (received / total) * 100;
		}
	}

	// Final decode
	result += decoder.decode();
	document.getElementById('output').textContent = result;
}

downloadWithProgress('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sindresorhus/awesome/main/readme.md');
</script>
üß† Notes
Content-Length header is essential for accurate progress; if the server doesn‚Äôt provide it, you can still show indeterminate progress (e.g. spinner).

Works for any streamable text, including .txt, .md, .csv, etc.

If you want to download and save the file with progress, use [Streams API + File System API] or blobs + URL.createObjectURL.

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
