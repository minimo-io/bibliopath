> Books themselves, as tools for freedom could not have a better match than Nostr.

Bibliopath is a Nostr-powered web-based ebook reader designed
for freedom and a **platform for authors to permissionless publish Creative Common books for the open-web**,
so readers can fund them and their books via zaps.

(Don't know What Nostr is? Read it [here](https://nostr.how/pt/what-is-nostr))

There are two parts for the project.

At its core, **Bibliopath** it's an ebook reader in the form of a PWA (Progressive Web App) designed for freedom, with offline reading and sharing of books stored locally on the device via IndexDB.

Readers should be able run their our local version of Bibliopath (via Docker), upload their own ePubs or markdown books, share and sync them locally. In summary, have total control over their books.

Readers donâ€™t even need an Internet connection, instead they can just download Bibliopath and use it as a local web reader in the browser (mobile and desktop).

This is its main purpose.

**Bibliopath** is also meant to be a community for Open Publishing and Open Funding of books and authors.

This online side of Bibliopath, the community, could not have a better match than Nostr.
Books themselves, are tools for freedom. Nostr, the permisionless social protocol, too.

Readers who want an online experience can:

- Read epubs and Markdown books, stored at any online git repository.
- Share complete creative common books.
- Access online books from Project Gutenberg.
- Share books in their library with nearby contacts or between own devices.
- Publish books via Nostr (making them censor-resistante), also share highlights.
- Fund authors and their books.
- Discuss book ideas.

Nostr should be transparent for the "normies" using Biblipath. Running under the hood, giving Biblipath social capabilities.
