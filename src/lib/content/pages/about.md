> Books themselves, as tools for freedom cannot have a better match than Nostr.

Bibliopath is a Nostr-powered web-based ebook reader designed for freedom and a platform authors to permissionless publish creative commons books for the open-web, and for readers to fund them via zaps, and much more.

There are two parts for the project.

At its core, **Bibliopath** is an ebook reader in the form of a PWA (Progressive Web App) designed for freedom, with offline reading and sharing of books stored locally on the device via IndexDB.

Readers should be able run their our local version of Bibliopath, upload their own ePubs or markdown books, share and sync them locally.

Readers donâ€™t even need an Internet connection, instead they can just download Bibliopath and use it as a local web reader in the browser (mobile and desktop).

This is its main purpose.

**Bibliopath** is also meant to be a community for Open Publishing and Open Funding of books and authors.

This online side of Bibliopath, the community, could not have a better match than Nostr.
Books themselves, are tools for freedom. Nostr, the permisionless social protocol, is too.

Readers who want an online experience can:

- Read epub and Markdown
- Share complete creative common books over Nostr, and much more, .
- Access online books from Project Gutenberg, GitHub repositories, or any other open source.
- Share books in your library with nearby contacts or between your own devices.
- Readers can publish books via Nostr (making them censor-resistante), also share highlights.
- Discuss book ideas.
- Readers can fund authors and their books can get funded by zappers.

Nostr should be transparent for the "normies" using Biblipath. Under the hood, runs Nostr.
